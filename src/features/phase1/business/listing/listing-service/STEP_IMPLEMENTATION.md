# 🎯 Step Implementation - Airbnb-Style Wizard

## Overview

Implemented the first step of the listing service wizard following Airbnb's exact design pattern. The system now has reusable components that make it easy to build consistent, beautiful steps.

## New Components

### 1. `StepLayout.tsx`

**Purpose:** Reusable layout wrapper for all steps

**Features:**

- Consistent header with title and optional subtitle
- "Save and exit" button in top-right
- Centered content area with max-width
- Clean, minimal design

**Usage:**

```tsx
<StepLayout
  title="How many years have you been a caterer?"
  subtitle="Step 1 of 6" // optional
  showSaveExit={true}
  onSaveExit={() => {}}
>
  {/* Your step content here */}
</StepLayout>
```

### 2. `NumberInput.tsx`

**Purpose:** Airbnb-style number input with +/- buttons

**Features:**

- Large centered number display
- Circular +/- buttons
- Min/max constraints
- Keyboard input support
- Hover and disabled states
- Accessibility labels

**Usage:**

```tsx
<NumberInput
  label="How many years have you been a caterer?"
  value={years}
  onChange={setYears}
  min={0}
  max={99}
  step={1}
  testId="years-of-experience-input"
/>
```

**Visual Design:**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                            │
│    (-)        15          (+)              │
│                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. Updated `WelcomeStep.tsx`

**Purpose:** First step asking about years in business

**Features:**

- Dynamic question based on business type
  - "How many years have you been a **caterer**?"
  - "How many years have you been a **photographer**?"
  - etc.
- Number input with +/- buttons
- Help text explaining the purpose
- Contextual messages:
  - 0 years: "Just starting out? That's great!"
  - 10+ years: "Established business! Your experience is valuable"
- Auto-calculates founded year from years input
- Updates data in real-time

## Implementation Details

### Step Structure

Every step now follows this pattern:

```tsx
const MyStep: React.FC<StepComponentProps> = ({ data, onDataChange }) => {
  const [localState, setLocalState] = useState(/* initial value */);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Update parent data when local state changes
    onDataChange({
      /* updated data */
    });
  }, [localState]);

  return (
    <StepLayout title="Your Question Here">
      {/* Your step content */}
      <NumberInput />
      {/* or other components */}
    </StepLayout>
  );
};
```

### Data Flow

1. **User interacts** with NumberInput
2. **Local state updates** (years)
3. **useEffect triggers** and calculates foundedYear
4. **onDataChange called** with updated data
5. **Parent modal receives** update
6. **ListingCreationData updated** in modal state

### Validation

The Welcome step is considered valid when:

- Years > 0 (handled automatically)
- foundedYear is calculated and stored

The modal's `canProceed()` function checks:

```tsx
case 1:
  return !!listingData.businessType;
```

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme

**Number Input:**

- Border: `gray-300` → `gray-400` on hover
- Text: `gray-900` (2xl, font-semibold)
- Buttons: `gray-300` border, `gray-50` background on hover
- Disabled: 30% opacity

**Help Messages:**

- Blue (starting out): `blue-50` bg, `blue-200` border, `blue-900` text
- Green (established): `emerald-50` bg, `emerald-200` border, `emerald-900` text

### Typography

- **Step Title:** `text-3xl`, `font-semibold`, `text-gray-900`
- **Subtitle:** `text-base`, `text-gray-600`
- **Help Text:** `text-sm`, `text-gray-600`
- **Number Display:** `text-2xl`, `font-semibold`, `text-gray-900`

### Spacing

- **Header margin:** `mb-8`
- **Content max-width:** `max-w-xl`
- **Help text margin:** `mt-6`
- **Context message margin:** `mt-4`
- **Input padding:** `py-4 px-6`

## Step 1: Years in Business

### Question Format

The question dynamically adapts to the business type selected in the prelude:

| Business Type     | Question                                                        |

| Consulting        | "How many years have you been a **consultant**?"                |

### Data Stored

```typescript
{
  basicInfo: {
    foundedYear: 2015; // Calculated from currentYear - years
  }
}
```

### Example Flow

1. User selects "Catering" in prelude
2. Navigates to listing service
3. Step 1 shows: "How many years have you been a caterer?"
4. User clicks + to increase to 10
5. System calculates: foundedYear = 2025 - 10 = 2015
6. Data stored: `basicInfo.foundedYear = 2015`
7. User clicks "Next"
8. Proceeds to Step 2

## Reusable Components Needed

To implement the remaining steps efficiently, we should create:

### Input Components

- ✅ `NumberInput` - Done!
- ✅ `StepLayout` - Done!
- ⚠️ `TextInput` - Single-line text
- ⚠️ `TextArea` - Multi-line text
- ⚠️ `Select` - Dropdown selector
- ⚠️ `Toggle` - On/off switch
- ⚠️ `FileUploader` - Drag & drop file upload
- ⚠️ `MultiSelect` - Multiple selection
- ⚠️ `LocationInput` - Location with autocomplete

### Design Tokens

All components should use consistent:

- Border radius: `rounded-xl` (12px)
- Border width: `border-2`
- Border colors: `gray-300` → `gray-400` on hover
- Padding: `py-4 px-6`
- Focus ring: `ring-2 ring-blue-100`
- Transitions: `transition-all duration-200`

## Testing the Flow

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Start dev server:**

   ```bash
   cd /Users/matthiasmandiau/Downloads/flyp/apps/flyp-frontend
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to listing creation:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/my-business/listings`
   - Click "Create New Listing"
   - Select "Catering" business type
   - Click "Get Started"

3. **Test Step 1:**
   - ✅ Should show: "How many years have you been a caterer?"
   - ✅ Default value should be 1 or calculated from profile
   - ✅ Click - button to decrease
   - ✅ Click + button to increase
   - ✅ Type directly in the input
   - ✅ Min value should be 0
   - ✅ Max value should be 99
   - ✅ Help text should appear
   - ✅ Context message at 0 years (blue)
   - ✅ Context message at 10+ years (green)
   - ✅ "Save and exit" button should be visible
   - ✅ Can click "Next" to proceed

4. **Verify data persistence:**
   - Check that `foundedYear` is calculated correctly
   - Go back and forth between steps
   - Value should persist

## Summary

**Status:** ✅ Step 1 Complete

**What's Done:**

- ✅ StepLayout component (reusable for all steps)
- ✅ NumberInput component (Airbnb-style +/- buttons)
- ✅ WelcomeStep with years in business question
- ✅ Dynamic question based on business type
- ✅ Contextual help messages
- ✅ Data persistence and calculation
- ✅ Build passing with no errors

**What's Next:**
You can now tell me what should be in Steps 2-8, and I'll implement them using the same pattern! Each step will:

- Use `StepLayout` for consistent structure
- Have its own specific input components
- Update data in real-time
- Validate before allowing "Next"
- Match Airbnb's visual style

Ready for your input on the next steps! 🚀
