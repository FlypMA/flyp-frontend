## 📊 Comparison Calculation Logic

### **Strategic Sale** (100% value)

```
Base Value = Estimated Valuation
+ Goodwill (20%)
+ Customer Relationships (15%)
+ Intellectual Property (10%)
+ Team Retention (10%)
+ Market Position (5%)
= 160% of base valuation
```

### **Liquidation** (~38% value)

```
Equipment (15% of valuation, but discounted)
+ Inventory (10%, clearance pricing)
+ Real Estate (5%, if applicable)
+ Accounts Receivable (8%, partial collection)
= 38% of strategic sale value
Lost: Brand, IP, Team, Relationships (62%)
```

### **Difference**: Typically 60-70% value loss in liquidation
