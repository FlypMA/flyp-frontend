## 📊 Comparison Calculations

### **Strategic Sale** (100% Value Preserved)

```javascript
const strategicSale = {
  baseValue: valuationMax,
  goodwill: valuationMax * 0.20,           // Brand value
  customerRelationships: valuationMax * 0.15, // Existing clients
  intellectualProperty: valuationMax * 0.10,  // IP, processes
  teamRetention: valuationMax * 0.10,       // Team stays
  marketPosition: valuationMax * 0.05,      // Market share
  total: sum of all above (160% of base valuation)
};
```

### **Liquidation** (~38% of Strategic Value)

```javascript
const liquidation = {
  equipment: valuationMax * 0.15,          // Physical assets at 30% discount
  inventory: valuationMax * 0.10,          // Quick sale discount
  realEstate: valuationMax * 0.05,         // If applicable
  accountsReceivable: valuationMax * 0.08, // Some won't collect
  lostValue: valuationMax * 0.62,          // Goodwill, IP, team, relationships LOST
  total: sum (excluding lostValue) ≈ 38% of strategic sale
};
```

**Difference**: Strategic Sale total - Liquidation total  
**Percentage Lost**: ~62% of potential value destroyed in liquidation
